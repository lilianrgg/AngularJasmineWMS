Wind Monitoring System project uses ASP.Net MVS project. Code is written mainly in AngularJS,JQuery etc. Unit testing is done with Jasmine, test runner is Chutzpah integrated with Visual Studio. Please install Chutzpah adapter for better testing. I have written only one test, just to integrate unit testing. Data used is also not complete. Can include more data going to respective services.
